ðŸŽ“ I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Data Science**, and Iâ€™m currently making a career transition to become a full-time **Full Stack Developer**.

ðŸ’» I'm enrolled in a **professional full stack development course** focused on practical, real-world skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, databases, Git, and more).  
ðŸŽ¯ At the same time, Iâ€™m pursuing a **postgraduate degree in Systems Analysis and Development** to deepen my understanding of software architecture and engineering principles.
